# Online_Bookstore_Project_using-SQL

## Overview
This project is a SQL-based analysis of an online bookstore database. It includes a wide range of queries from basic data retrieval (e.g., listing fiction books, filtering by country or date) to advanced analytics such as calculating total revenue, identifying top customers, and tracking inventory. The queries help explore customer behavior, book sales, stock levels, and genre trends, making it a complete mini-case study in SQL for e-commerce data.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to explore and analyze data from an online bookstore using SQL. Through a series of practical queries, the project aims to answer real-world business questions such as tracking book sales, monitoring stock, identifying top customers, and analyzing genre trends. Itâ€™s designed to strengthen SQL skills while working with realistic e-commerce data.
