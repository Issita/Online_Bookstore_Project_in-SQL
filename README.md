# Online_Bookstore_Project_using-SQL

## Overview
This project is a SQL-based analysis of an online bookstore database. It includes a wide range of queries from basic data retrieval (e.g., listing fiction books, filtering by country or date) to advanced analytics such as calculating total revenue, identifying top customers, and tracking inventory. The queries help explore customer behavior, book sales, stock levels, and genre trends, making it a complete mini-case study in SQL for e-commerce data.
